This repository demonstrates a common SQL error related to handling `NULL` values in comparisons.  The `bug.sql` file shows an incorrect query that fails to retrieve rows with `NULL` values due to misuse of standard comparison operators. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides the corrected query using the `IS NULL` operator.  This example highlights the importance of understanding how `NULL` values behave in SQL and the correct methods for handling them.
